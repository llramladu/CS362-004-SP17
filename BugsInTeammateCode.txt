Bug Found: SmithyError: The wrong number of cards is drawn, the number of cards in hand, and in the deck do not change by exactly 3 when the state is setup to have 3 cards to draw. Cause: It is likely that the cause is the bug that was introduced in assignment 2 where the for loop as a <= instead of just a <.Severity: This could be a sever bug, with the player being able to buy items with more coins than they should have been able to have.Priority: This should be a pretty high priority but not an immediate priority to fix.Bug Found: AdventurerError: Causes program to crash when being tested.Cause: It is likely caused by the bug that was introduced in assignment 2, but it also might have some issues with the way the code was refactored into the function adventurerM(). This will take some time to sort out exactly what is going on.Severity: As high as it gets, crashing so nothing else works means I canÕt even do any other tests, or have to work around this one.Priority: This needs to be fixed as soon as possible.
